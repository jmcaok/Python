## Modulo

The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division, which is useful for finding out if a given number is divisible by another.

You can think of it like a clock:

On the clock, we only have 12 hours, but there are 24 hours in a day.

If it's 10:00, then on the clock, it is 10 o'clock.

But if it's 17:00, then on the clock, it is 5 o'clock.

This is because the clock works by taking the time modulo 12:

17 % 12 = 5

10 % 12 = 10

You can use this to check if a year is divisible by 100, 400, or 4.
